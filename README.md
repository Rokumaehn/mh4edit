## Introduction
A savegame editor for Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3ds.
It handles the decryption and re-encryption of savegames, so no need to do that manually.
Currently there is an item box editor, an equipment box editor and a WIP guild quest editor.
## Known Bugs
- The waist armor ids are off at some point
## Things needed
- A list of all armors and weapons that are relics (Id, Name). So that the editor can properly show or lock the editing of relic-specific settings.
